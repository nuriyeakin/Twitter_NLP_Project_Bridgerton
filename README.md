# Twitter_NLP_Project_Bridgerton

I have decided to mine tweet about Netflix's Bridgerton TV Series since it's on the TOP 10 again with its second season.

I mined almost 100K tweets. I will try two different approaches. I will use half of the tweets on the first approach and half of them on the second approach.

# First Notebook: Bridgerton_Tweet_Analysis.ipynb

## On the first approach:

Used: Python libraries 
* Pandas (for Data Cleaning/Manipulation)
* Tweepy (for Tweets Mining)
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) 
* TextBlob (for Sentiment Analysis) 
* MatPlotlib & Seaborn & WordCloud (for Data Visualization)
* Emot (for Emojis identification)
* Plotly (for some Data Visualization)

Most popular hashtags:
